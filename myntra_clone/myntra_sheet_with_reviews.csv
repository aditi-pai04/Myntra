5,quality and the fitting is too good. Really impressed with how it fits my body. As I have heavy thighs I was skeptical on the fitting but when I wore it it just looked amazing and fitted well. The material. the look of the product is great. Color is as shown in the image. The sizing is as per the size chart. One might feel from the product description that it would be a mini skort but it isn't that mini. Just a little above the knee for me. You can totally go ahead and buy it. highly recommended.

8,I ordered xl but it's too short. So have to return. I also ordered pink xl which is exact xl size. Color is good. Material is not cotton. As it's mentioned in description. Overall it's good. I also had green one which I am using from 3years. I write it for people who think it's cotten as some customers write material is cotton. Iron after every wash.
8,Pros: 1. The cloth material is soft. 2. Comfortable for summer days. 3. The preplum cut and lace detailing is pretty. Cons: 1. Its thin and translucent and thought the lace detailing on the front keeps it kinda opaque in the front. Would suggest wearing nude underwear do not wear white ones."
8,Not what I expected
8,May look short but looks good when you put it on. The only minus is the transparency. It's medium transparent so you might want to pair it with a camisole.
